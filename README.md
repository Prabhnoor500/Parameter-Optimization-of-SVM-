# Parameter-Optimization-of-SVM-


### About the Project
    
Choose any multi-class dataset from UCI library.Dataset size must have rows between 5k and 30k.Divide the dataset into 70-30 for traing and testing with 10 different samples.Optimize the SVM for every sample with 1000 iterations and report the best parameters in a table.Plot the convergence graph for the sample whose accuracy is maximum.
   
#### Table : Comparative Performance Of Optimized-SVM with different samples

### Results
1> Best Performing Sample:- S9 is the best sample among all 10 samples with the best accuracy of 0.733333333 and the best parameters are given by:-
2> Kernel - "poly"
3> Nu - 0.361138733
4> Gamma - 0.964813518


## Dataset Used 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Anuran+Calls+%28MFCCs%29

## Tasks Performed
1. Download the dataset
2. Pre-process the dataset
3. Create ten samples 
4. Split the samples in  70 : 30 for training and testing
5. Optimise SVM using randomisation for every sample and report best accuracy and best parameters
6. For the best sample plot the convergence graph

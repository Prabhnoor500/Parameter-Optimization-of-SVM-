# Parameter-Optimization-of-SVM-


### About the Project
    
Choose any multi-class dataset from UCI library.Dataset size must have rows between 5k and 30k.Divide the dataset into 70-30 for traing and testing with 10 different samples.Optimize the SVM for every sample with 1000 iterations and report the best parameters in a table.Plot the convergence graph for the sample whose accuracy is maximum.
